As much as I loved the hands-on aspect of cutting and gluing, what really captivated me was the design process, and the creative nature of engineering. The progression from an idea to a plan to a functional object creates a sense of accomplishment that is difficult to find in other hobbies. Joining Stuy Fission 310 during my freshman year felt natural. Robotics encourages the same kind of creative problem solving I loved about model airplanes, and success as a team is based on a good execution of the design process. My favorite parts of the season are the days I spend brainstorming with my team, joking around and coming up with creative and sometimes crazy solutions to the game&apos;s challenges. As a leader, I focus on documentation, coordinating outreach and sponsorships, and newbie education such that my team can grow into the future. \n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Our Team"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"facebook":{"appId":""}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/team/","source":"pages"}}
