We faced many challenges with our relic mechanism stringing and wiring system, as well as with our acquirerâ€™s ability to fit into dimension and align glyphs to our glyph-scoring ramp.  While we were not able to solve all of these issues at the competition, these issues taught us a lot about how we can prevent similar design flaws in the future.</p>\n<p>For the past many weeks, one problem that we kept noticing was that in spite of how carefully we set up the stringing for the linear slides in our relic mechanism, one string inevitably loosened and became tangled with our other robot components.  To solve this problem, we consulted a member from team Brainstormers, who helped us figure out that the reason our string kept loosening was because the type of string we were using stretched over time.  Thanks to the generosity of team Geared Up, we were able to get a different type of string to use.  Although we could only get enough string to replace the retracting string, we were still able to notice some improvement in the slide function.</p>\n<p>Another issue with our relic mechanism that we had to overcome was that the servos used to clamp onto the relic would often become disconnected from the robot electronics.  We realized that the way we had managed the multiple sets of extension wires for the slides put the wires at risk of becoming unplugged when the slides extended or retracted.  Looking at other robots, we realized that in order to fix this issue, we would have to wind our extension wires around an elastic telephone cable, instead of trying to have them arranged in the zig-zag way that mimics the linear slide string.</p>\n<p>In order for our acquirer to work, it needed to be able to fit within the 18-inch sizing cube at the start of the match, and fold outwards once the robot begins driving, so that it is ready for acquiring.  On the day of the qualification matches, we discovered that, although the acquirer fit comfortably within dimensions when folded up, it would not fall out when the robot started driving.  In order to remedy this situation, we had to place a set of stoppers on the hinges that allowed the acquirer to fold in and out.  The stoppers prevented the acquirer from folding inwards too much, and allowed our acquirer to fall forwards once the robot began driving.</p>\n<p>Our acquirer also had many issues with aligning glyphs to the ramp that would place them into the cryptobox.  One issue was that some of the holes for the intake wheel axles were intentionally misaligned, so that our robot could fit in dimension.  We tensioned our axles with zip-ties in order to force the glyphs to be acquired at a better angle.  Another issue was that the base plate for the intake was quite elastic, and when it bent the sprockets became misaligned, causing the chain connecting the motors to the wheels to come off.  We reinforced the base plate using an aluminum channel, causing it to be less elastic.  We also used zip-ties to tension the chain and prevent it from slipping off its sprockets.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/supers-pit/","prefix":"2018-03-28"},"frontmatter":{"title":"In the Pit at Supers","author":"Saahir Ganti-Agrawal","category":"Competition","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/56d0119ba73a32f7cb9ce08b4b649b88/ada8c/regionals.jpg"}}}}},"authornote":{"id":"ed12eb76-f3aa-5abb-888e-01033540e2b9","html":"<p><strong>Stuy Fission 310</strong> Stuy Fission is an FTC team based at Stuyvesant High School, New York.
