Last Saturday was Kickoff, which was held at NYU School of Engineering in Brookyln. Both Stuy Fission 310 and Stuy Fusion 479, attended the game reveal and were both exicted about this years new challenge. We invited all of our newbies to join us as we look at this year's game, Rover Ruckus! We are proud to say that 30 of them attended Kickoff last week.

Big Announcement! Our sister team, Stuy Fusion 479, recently created their team website! Check out their [site](http://fusion479.com/) for more updates!
