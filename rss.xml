&lt;p&gt;The current drivetrain is a four-wheel mecanum drive, useful for navigational control (since the robot can move in any direction). To counter the problem of not being able to get onto the balancing stone, the plates on the side of the robot were cut to a 45 degree angle &lt;em&gt;behind the wheels&lt;/em&gt;. Our electronics are now mounted on lexan plates on the sides of the robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous Iteration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our previous drivetrain was a standard four-wheel tankdrive, with the wheels chained onto motors mounted on the chassis. Because the motors were placed above the chassis, rather than below it, the robot can maintain a lower center of gravity. However, this posed the problem of not being able to drive onto the balancing stone. This issue was fixed by placing a wedge on the back of the robot, which pushes the stone down while we drive backwards onto it. Our electronics, including the REV Expansion Hubs, were mounted on a sheet of lexan on the underside of the chassis, while the name plates are mounted on the robot’s sides.&lt;/p&gt;

The new acquirer is completely remade from the previous two versions, and consists of a dropdown plate that contains inwardly-spinning wheels. This plate falls down outside the 18-inch sizing requirement during autonomous, allowing us to fit a larger mechanism within the 18x18x18 dimensions. When glyphs come into contact with the wheels, the wheels spin the glyph onto the acquirer plate and into the hopper/flipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous Iterations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous acquirer had two mechanisms: the lift and the clamping servos. A servo on either side of the acquirer controlled a vertical rod, and turning the servos in opposite directions allowed the rods to clamp onto glyphs. The lift, made of drawer slides and attached to a spool of string, could then raise the clamped glyph to score or stack the glyph onto another glyph. If a glyph was stacked on top of another, both glyphs could be picked up at the same time by the clamping rods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orginal version of the acquirer divided the acquirer vertically into two with a door hinge, allowing the acquirer to clamp glyphs using two top servos, raise the hinge, and clamp another glyph using the two bottom servos. However, we realized this process was slow and ineffective, leading us to remove a servo from either side and combining the clampers on each side into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hopper and Flipper&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
After being acquired, glyphs are stored in the robot on a ramp, which serves as both the hopper and the foundation for the flipping mechanism. In order to score the glyphs, the ramp will flip in the opposite direction of the acquirer, expelling the glyphs into the cryptobox. The robot will also be able to expel glyphs from the acquirer by spinning the acquirer motors in the opposite direction. The advantages of this system are that: 1) it’s not necessary to turn around after acquiring glyphs from the glyph pit, and 2) glyphs can be scored from both sides of the robot, which is useful during the autonomous period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relic mechanism consists of a set of horizontal linear slides and a two-degrees-of-freedom servo clamp. The linear slides extend far enough so that the robot can pick up the relic from behind the balancing stone, which can be used as an alignment mechanism, saving precious endgame time. The clamp is used to grab on to the relic, and also rotates to pick the glyph up off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Arm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arm is a square channel connected to a servo at one end, allowing the servo to freely rotate the channel in 180 degrees. The arm has a color sensor mounted at the other end, and its purpose is to detect the color of a jewel during the autonomous period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Autonomous&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the kickoff video ended, we knew autonomous scoring was going to play a huge role in this year’s game. Using a practice drivetrain as a testing robot, various autonomous routines were written, including a drive straight program using encoders and an IMU, a turn program using an IMU, and a jewel scoring program, which utilized the color sensor on the arm. We also experimented with Vuforia and detecting the VuMark, but the robot was unable to consistently drive to the target cryptobox column to score the glyph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;John Dewey Qualifiers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our autonomous plan for our first qualifier was to simply score the jewel and park in the Safe Zone. However, during practice, something in the electronics malfunctioned and the color sensor would cause the Expansion Hub to lag during initialization, which made it take up to two minutes for the OpMode to become startable. We were able to solve this problem by removing the color sensor, but we were no longer able to use our jewel autonomous program; instead, we settled for parking in the Safe Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Francis Lewis Qualifiers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the second qualifier, we were able to use computer vision (CV) to detect jewel colors and score the jewel in autonomous. We were also able to combine this with our previous Safe Zone park autonomous to perform a 40 point auton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New York City Regionals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While general robot issues prevented us from scoring our full potential during the competition, we had an 85 point auton prepared; building off of the 40 from Francis Lewis, we were able to score one glyph and earn the Cryptobox Key bonus, adding another 45 points.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our Team]]></title><description><![CDATA[Executive Council Lili Boenigk Senior, President

My favorite hobby growing up was building balsa wood model airplanes. As much as I loved the hands-on aspect of cutting and gluing, what really captivated me was the design process, and the creative nature of engineering. The progression from an idea to a plan to a functional object creates a sense of accomplishment that is difficult to find in other hobbies. Joining Stuy Fission 310 during my freshman year felt natural. Robotics encourages the same kind of creative problem solving I loved about model airplanes, and success as a team is based on a good execution of the design process. My favorite parts of the season are the days I spend brainstorming with my team, joking around and coming up with creative and sometimes crazy solutions to the game’s challenges. As a leader, I focus on documentation, coordinating outreach and sponsorships, and newbie education such that my team can grow into the future. &lt;/p&gt;

When I was young, my parents thought that it was very important to try everything to try to find what you love. I tried everything from ballet to art to robotics. I was lucky enough to find what I love so early on. Through all the insane things that I have tried, robotics has always stuck. When I came to Stuyvesant, I was overwhelmed, as everyone is when they walk through the entrance on the first day of school. Getting lost at such a large school is easy and everyone needs someplace that grounds them. Robotics is that place for me. I love every part of the competition, the building, marketing, scouting, strategics, the mentors and mentees and it has become a part of my identity. As the vice president of this team, I work to move our team forward whether that is writing the Engineering Notebook, teaching newbies, delegating building and coding, organizing outreach events, or meeting with mentors and coaches to discuss different aspects of the team. This robotics team has become my family and there is no other team I’d rather go through competition season with. I enjoy mentoring 2 FLL teams and playing lacrosse in my free time.&lt;/p&gt;

I was always interested in engineering and coming up with creative solutions to problems. Whether these solutions involved LEGOs, paper, or even popsicle sticks, I enjoyed the creativity and the variability of my solutions. By joining robotics and FTC, I was able to continue what I love doing. Except now, it’s not LEGOs anymore, but metal, wood, and aluminum where we use these parts to build actual robots that can do specific tasks. As the Head of Engineering, I am responsible for the completion of the various mechanisms and prototypes and the integration into our robot. I believe our robot can strive towards higher expectations, because our team is constantly being challenged from our own peers and mentors. These past 3 years on the team has been great and fun to work with because each year there is something different among the game, the robot and even our team. As a senior at Stuy, here’s to one more unforgettable last year. ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)&lt;/p&gt;

Growing up in Queens, NY I always envisioned myself doing something in the big city, Manhattan. I’ll admit, I had no idea what I wanted to do in the city, but the dream of transforming people’s lives for the greater always sparked an inner flame. I suppose you can say that I was inspired by my favorite superhero Tony Stark. The first Iron Man film inspired me to love robotics. So it was definitely no surprise that I chose to join my school’s FTC Robotics team as a freshman in high school. I started out an engineer on the team but it was only after the first qualifiers of my sophomore year that I saw how lacking the Software Engineering department was. From that point on I decided to change gears and become a software engineer for the team. Now as a senior in high school, I can look back at all the ways I changed, but also look forward to how I can influence others around me. This year, I will step in the shoes of my predecessors and fulfill the role of leading the SE department. I know this year will be challenging, leading a group of newbies was never a common skill of mine, but with the support of my team, I know that I can do something that younger Joe could only dream of. I made it my mission to motivate the generation before me and I know that by leading my current SE team to the best of my ability now, they will be able to carry my vision to the next generation and the generation after that.&lt;/p&gt;

As a child, my eagerness to learn was only surpassed by my awkwardness around others. I found it troublesome connecting with others for few of my peers had the same background as I did. I was an immigrant coming from Bangladesh and my parents had, from an early age on, stressed the importance of a well-rounded education. I found my niche at Stuyvesant High School and specifically in Team Fission. It was an environment that nurtured my passion for the maths and sciences, but more importantly, it allowed me to shed my former shyness. Joining the robotics team taught me the importance of people skills and synergy. Working closely with the team and hearing their ideas encouraged me to speak up more and share my own opinion. As a senior, my time with the team — the long meetings, the late dinners, the competitions, the cheering — has immensely shaped my character, and what I’ve learned about teamwork and working amongst others is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. &lt;/p&gt;

My name is Qiao Ying (Emily) and this is my first year in robotics. I joined because I thought I would enjoy engineering and it would be a chance to learn a bit of software. I thought robotics would give lots of opportunities for me to interact with different people. I am also interested in drawing and sketching, which is also why I wanted to mainly do engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time that I saw a machine deconstructed was when my dad took apart a broken alarm clock when I was 10. Each individual part that made up the clock intrigued me. The composition of seemingly simple pieces worked together to create a functioning machine with a specific purpose. During middle school, I experimented with code and developed a liking towards it. Similar to the alarm clock, the composition of each line of code worked together to form a program. I joined robotics because I want to develop and apply my ability to code to a project that I can work on with others.&lt;/p&gt;

As a child, I loved reading mystery/spy fiction books, where characters got out of sticky situations using their wits and abilities. I was always in awe of the characters who would resourcefully build a contraption or use their knowledge of mechanisms to figure things out. I fueled this interest by watching YouTube videos and reading instructions on WikiHow to make my own motion detectors and homemade mousetrap cars. If not begging my mom to take to me to RadioShack, I would always take old pens and electronic toys apart, salvaging the parts and hoarding them for years, just in case I needed them for a project. When I entered high school, robotics was the only club I had my eyes for. Our victory banners covering the walls of our school gave me a sense of pride and excitement to join and contribute. Joining this team was critical for my development because I suddenly realized there was so much I didn’t know. Especially because the majority of my teammates were in FLL teams and already familiar with robotics, I felt super isolated from my team. However, this gave me the opportunity to figure out what exactly I was missing and work on it. As a freshman, I was intimidated by the upperclassmen but soon gained confidence talk to them about their experiences in engineering. This helped me to take initiative outside of school and robotics, and pave my passion for engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a very young age, my parents always expected very much of me. They would always compare me to others and tell me how I’m lacking behind. To please them, I tried to make it to stuy, and I ended up doing just that. The first day here, I could already tell it’s going to be very hard, with the amount of stairs we have to climb and quizzes and test every week. I joined robotics as a way to relieve my stress and have some fun making new friends. My personal hobbies and interests are sleeping, eating, playing, and watching anime. By joining robotics, I hope to find someone with the same interest as me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I loved to create things. I have always been more interested in the tangible and things that take up space. That is why I picked up drawing. It was a way for me to make things that are also visually appealing. However, I soon learned that it would not be of much use to me in the future to just draw. Though I have no hate to those with art degrees and careers involving the arts, I feel that it would never benefit me in any way other than to be to brag about how well I draw; which isn’t that well at all. So when I learned that Stuyvesant had a robotics team, I knew that it would be the perfect club for me. Robotics can give me a chance to learn how to make machines and program them to do tasks that we can do. Furthermore, programming had always caught my interest in this growing age of technology. The only problem was that I didn’t know how to start learning, so when I was given an opportunity to learn it, I took it. That is why I joined robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

My name is Naomi, and this is my first year in robotics. Since I was a child I always loved the idea of being on a team and getting to work with others to create something new. So when I learned that Stuyvesant had a robotics team, I quickly signed up. So far it has been a great experience being on 310 and learning from the mentors on my time. I look forward to spending time in robotics, and with my new team. Some other things that I enjoy in my free time are reading and songwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined robotics because I have done robotics with FIRST for a long time and I really liked it, so I wanted to maintain the action by joining Stuy’s team. Currently, I am but a newbie on the team and am still learning the ropes.&lt;/p&gt;

I joined robotics because it requires like no experience and it seemed really fun. A lot of my friends also joined robotics so I thought why not also join. since I would also prefer a job in engineering or something related to that, robotics could help give me some experience.  I like robotics because it can prepare me for jobs, its somewhat easy going, and its enjoyable. Outside of robotics I like to eat, sleep, and stay somewhere warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robotics has been a huge part of my life ever since 5th grade, when I was first introduced to robotics and LEGO Mindstorms. It was in middle school when I was first introduced to FIRST through FLL. From my first competition, I know I wanted to do this for a long time. So, when I came to Stuyvesant, I joined the robotics team. However, I didn’t join Stuy Fission. I joined FRC 694 StuyPulse. I’m now spending my fourth year on the team, and am currently the President of Engineering. My time with FTC starts in junior year when one of our sister teams, FTC 479 Stuy Fusion, was extremely short on members. I joined them, and helped them with their robot as much as possible inside and out of competition. This is when I became attached to FTC. This year, I joined FTC 310 Stuy Fission and work to help the team specifically with engineering and strategy. I hope to put my passion for robotics to use and help this amazing team reach new heights.&lt;/p&gt;

James Lonardo has served our team for over eight years. He attends many of our late night, weekend and break meetings all year long. He organizes all of our paperwork from our medicals to trip forms, which is no easy task when Stuyvesant Robotics has close to one hundred and twenty members. Mr. Lonardo proves to be the “backbone of our team” when he signs us up for events and orders all of the parts that we need for the season.&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. Blay has had a tremendous impact on our team since his own high school years. Mr. Blay was actually a former Stuyvesant High School student, graduating in 2009. While a student, he was a member of our sister team, FRC StuyPulse 694, and now he is a teacher at Stuyvesant (engineering design, precalculus, and technical drawing). His incredible dedication to the team is really an inspiration to us, reminding us, especially the seniors, the importance of coming back and continuing to influence and contribute to the team even after graduation. His presence is also what allows us to have our late night or weekend meetings that are crucial to ensuring that our robot is completed in a timely manner. This year he has become more committed to helping our team get the furthest we have ever gotten. He has helped us come up with unique ideas for mechanisms, calculate torque and speed to make crucial choices, complete driver tryouts, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

Levi is a StuyPulse alum, who graduated just last year and now attends New York University, majoring Mechanical Engineering. Since then he has come back and continued to work with 694 (our sister FRC team) as well as move more into FTC. He has helped us immensely with prototyping the tape measure mechanism as well as gearing and motor calculations. Levi has become someone that many of us rely on for anything from a friend to a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

Noah, like Levi, is a StuyPulse alum. He has been mentoring teams since as long as anyone can remember. He is very passionate and is not afraid to say what he thinks. This is a great quality to have as a mentor because that means he is not afraid to tell us what is wrong with whatever we are doing whether that is judge’s meet or our acquirer or newbie education. Noah has been there for us since day one, even mentoring our vice president when she was in FLL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zhengqi Xi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhengqi started as a mentor for us through a Bloomberg program and has been with us ever since. He is able to facilitate many of the conversations we have about design and engineering season because of his background in the fields of robotics and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mel Hauptman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mel has helped us tremendously this year especially in our engineering process. Being a mechanical engineer, he has a very solid foundation and can predict all the faults of our designs. He has been useful when talking about all of our different hanging mechanisms and he has definitely helped us avoid some disastrous design issues. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[FTC Splash]]></title><description><![CDATA[On October 8th, the CEPC  planned and hosted FTC Splash.

&lt;p&gt;On October 8th, the CEPC  planned and hosted FTC Splash. Both our Head of Engineering and our Head of Software Engineering gave lectures during the event. It was an amazing time and we had a great time learning from and teaching other FTC teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started off with some brief icebreakers and afterwards we got straight into the lectures about CADing and a combination of Intro to Java and CV from our two heads (Engineering and Software). They did an amazing job, being the first ones, and set the tone for the day. Many teams attend both to learn more about important processes of building and coding a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the other lectures were also given by students, two of them coming from our sister team, Fusion 479. We attended lectures all day, splitting up so that we could hear more lectures. This was an enriching experience because even though we are a well established team, there is always more for us to learn.
During the day, members also attended the Women in STEM lecture in which there was a brief presentation and a open floor type of discussion. We learned about many more girls and their struggles and triumphs in STEM and more specifically FTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was another team whose story we heard. The girls were from Nightingale, an all girls school. Most of the bias they faced wasn’t coming from being female, but mostly from being females interested in STEM in a humanities school. We realized how fortunate we were to be in a team and school that supported us and our female members. After the lecture, we talked more with the Nightingale team and decided that we had the resources and time to help and mentor them. Ever since, we have stayed in contact with them and are looking forward to working with them in the near future!

We faced many challenges with our relic mechanism stringing and wiring system, as well as with our acquirer’s ability to fit into dimension and align glyphs to our glyph-scoring ramp.  While we were not able to solve all of these issues at the competition, these issues taught us a lot about how we can prevent similar design flaws in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past many weeks, one problem that we kept noticing was that in spite of how carefully we set up the stringing for the linear slides in our relic mechanism, one string inevitably loosened and became tangled with our other robot components.  To solve this problem, we consulted a member from team Brainstormers, who helped us figure out that the reason our string kept loosening was because the type of string we were using stretched over time.  Thanks to the generosity of team Geared Up, we were able to get a different type of string to use.  Although we could only get enough string to replace the retracting string, we were still able to notice some improvement in the slide function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue with our relic mechanism that we had to overcome was that the servos used to clamp onto the relic would often become disconnected from the robot electronics.  We realized that the way we had managed the multiple sets of extension wires for the slides put the wires at risk of becoming unplugged when the slides extended or retracted.  Looking at other robots, we realized that in order to fix this issue, we would have to wind our extension wires around an elastic telephone cable, instead of trying to have them arranged in the zig-zag way that mimics the linear slide string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for our acquirer to work, it needed to be able to fit within the 18-inch sizing cube at the start of the match, and fold outwards once the robot begins driving, so that it is ready for acquiring.  On the day of the qualification matches, we discovered that, although the acquirer fit comfortably within dimensions when folded up, it would not fall out when the robot started driving.  In order to remedy this situation, we had to place a set of stoppers on the hinges that allowed the acquirer to fold in and out.  The stoppers prevented the acquirer from folding inwards too much, and allowed our acquirer to fall forwards once the robot began driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our acquirer also had many issues with aligning glyphs to the ramp that would place them into the cryptobox.  One issue was that some of the holes for the intake wheel axles were intentionally misaligned, so that our robot could fit in dimension.  We tensioned our axles with zip-ties in order to force the glyphs to be acquired at a better angle.  Another issue was that the base plate for the intake was quite elastic, and when it bent the sprockets became misaligned, causing the chain connecting the motors to the wheels to come off.  We reinforced the base plate using an aluminum channel, causing it to be less elastic.  We also used zip-ties to tension the chain and prevent it from slipping off its sprockets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volunteering at NYC FLL Championship]]></title><description><![CDATA[This past Sunday was the NYC FLL Championship.

&lt;p&gt;This past Sunday was the NYC FLL Championship. Several members of our team are heavily involved with FLL - both through mentoring and volunteering for events. As such, we were very excited to volunteer for the Championship. In combination with our sister team (FRC StuyPulse 694) and our school’s Honor Society, we were referees, mentors, queuers and judges. Although volunteering was difficult and tiring, especially with 63(!) teams present, 24 judging rooms and 2 different buildings, the enthusiasm of the FLL teams was infectious. Queuing allowed me the opportunity to interact with teams as I brought them to their judging rooms. In these short trips, I had the opportunity to talk to these students about their projects and robots. As I learned about the various solutions these elementary and middle schoolers came up with, I was seriously impressed by the level of knowledge and maturity that these students show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also impressed by the robots of the teams we mentor. Team 5355 reached rank 4 with a high score of 160! Although 5893, 9577, 28864, 2562, and the 11841 did not place in the top ten, we were amazed by the sophistication of their bots as well as all they learned in the building process. We are looking forward to watching these teams grow in coming years!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Preparing for Supers]]></title><description><![CDATA[With just three days left to work in the lab before Super Regionals we are very hopeful about our ability to succeed at the upcoming…]]></description><link>https://joesuzuki.github.io/Fission310//preparations/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://joesuzuki.github.io/Fission310//preparations/</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With just three days left to work in the lab before Super Regionals we are very hopeful about our ability to succeed at the upcoming competition and hopefully make it to Worlds for the first time! Since the NYC regional, we have worked to improve our robot’s autonomous, fixed many of our robot’s faulty mechanisms, and worked to prepare for judges meet and scout out the teams we’re facing at competition this coming weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the NYC Regional our code for autonomous period had many bugs which resulted in our robot spinning in circles and failing to push over any of the jewels (much less the right one!). We have fixed the turn algorithm so that the robot turns in the closer direction every time, and reversed the jewel arm extension so that it hits the jewels outwards onto the field, instead of into the field wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of our robot’s hardware we have also made many improvements. Our flipping ramp has been replaced from a lexan ramp which didn’t have walls to an aluminum ramp with edges that allow for much more accurate placement of the glyphs. We also improved the lift for the mechanism by adding washers to prevent the string from becoming caught. Additionally, we have fine-tuned our relic mechanism so that we can prevent it from becoming unstrung and hopefully achieve a double relic within 45 seconds. Our final major change to our robot over the past few weeks has been to modify our acquirer in two major ways. First, we switched the side that the acquirer was attached to so as to prevent it from interfering with the relic mechanism. Secondly, we changed the wheeled intake from using a combination of small and large stealth wheels to using four 4” compliant wheels which we believe do a much better job of acquiring glyphs. We suspect that with these changes we will be able to acquire and deposit 8-10 glyphs during the course of teleop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also extensively worked to prep the team for competition. We have scouted out the abilities of many of the teams going to supers through posts on YouTube, FIRST website, team’s social media accounts, and team websites. Further, we have prepared our team for Judge’s meet by holding tryouts and run-throughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re very excited to meet new teams and see how other teams have approached this year’s challenge, and we’re very grateful to our mentors and sponsors for this opportunity! Tell us what your team has been doing to prepare for supers or how you’ve been spending the off season!&lt;/p&gt;

Despite facing tremendous technical difficulties with almost every part of our robot we were nominated for the Connect and Think award, and we were able to win the PTC Design Award and the 3rd place Inspire Award. By winning the 3rd place Inspire Award, we advanced to the East Super-Regional competition in Scranton, Pennsylvania from March 16-18th!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the qualification matches, many of our robot’s components failed to function properly, and we were thus unable to win any of our five matches.  In our first match, we did not properly secure some wires and the battery, and we disconnected early on in the match.  In our other matches, we faced difficulties with keeping our glyph intake chain aligned, preventing glyphs from getting stuck in the middle of our robot, and preventing the strings and wiring in the relic mechanism from jamming.  In addition, our autonomous routine faced issues with aligning with the cryptobox to score and scoring the jewel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot thank our mentors and advisors enough for supporting us throughout the weeks leading up to this regional competition.  Our coaches Mr. Blay and Mr. Lonardo worked tirelessly to help us build our robot: volunteering their midwinter break to schedule and supervise meetings at our school throughout this time, helping us coordinate our trip to Townsend Harris, and even bringing our robot and spare parts to competition for us. We would not have been able to win these awards without our mentors’ help. Additionally, we would like to thank the efforts of the many volunteers who made this competition a resounding success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were very impressed with so many of the teams from the NYC regional and offer our congratulations to all that advance. We are super excited to be continuing to Super Regionals and we look forward to competing with the teams from across the Northeast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are Stuy Fission 310, a FTC team from New York City. Our team is comprised of dedicated Stuyvesant High School students who not only wish to do well in competition but also to spread the values of FIRST. We all come from very diverse backgrounds; for some of us, this is our first time getting involved in STEM,  while others of us have been involved in FLL and other programs. Being part of the team not only allows us to be part of a family that shares the same interests, but it also allows us to learn from each other and grow. Read our team charter &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRibYT1fPT5m-EED_3-dfcTeWcMDQpBzW7PgNiCVE2wFDamdE8i9dZcu-sqyL6qxQLTjtqYvhDHrKcI/pub&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team becomes a family not only because of our shared interests, but also because of the dedication each and every member shows. Members of our team juggle keeping their grades up in a competitive school as well as spending time together almost every day. In the final weeks of build season, the team stays after school until 9 pm, and then on Saturdays from 10 am to 5 pm. This is largely possible thanks to our hardworking mentors, whom we owe much of our success. On top of this, many of our members mentor FLL and other FTC teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though these late meetings are often difficult to manage, they bring our team together. Late meetings include communal dinners, team bonding activities (snowball fights, stacking the cubes with our feet as well as actual bonding events like bowling etc.), and the sometimes hilarious situations that arise as we build (we really never fail to make each other laugh).&lt;/p&gt;

Stuyvesant High School, a.k.a. “Stuy”, one of New York City’s specialized high schools for math and science, has demonstrated a tradition of excellence for over a century. Entrance is based on a rigorous and competitive test called the SHSAT; over 22,300 students take the exam every year and only about 900 are admitted to attend Stuy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totaling over 3200 students from all five city boroughs and diverse international backgrounds, Stuy is located in a modern, ten-story building in Lower Manhattan, having been relocated from the original building on East 15th Street in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What makes Stuy Fission unique?&lt;/h3&gt;

One of the things we take pride in is our overwhelming diversity. More than half of our team members were either born outside of the United States or are children of first generation immigrants.
Stuy Fission has also been a championship team over the last few years. Four years ago, we were the Alliance Captain at the New York City Regionals and advanced to Super Regionals. We were also on the Winning Alliance at the same regionals last year while winning the Dalton Qualifiers as the Alliance Captain, and this year, we have advanced to Super Regionals again, as the Inspire 3rd Place winner.&lt;/p&gt;

Stuy Fission’s first website was started by Ryan Siu in the 2017-2018 season, and serves as a virtual portfolio of our team as well as a blog to update other teams about our progress. It will be maintained by the Head of Software Engineering, who will oversee the addition of new pages and/or updated content. Blog posts can be added by any team member; the website is designed to make creating new posts simple.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Community]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stuy Fission 310  hosts many out-of-school events thoughout the season.

&lt;h3&gt;Book Drive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/d0RSdSe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book Drive&quot; width=&quot;49%&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;padding-left:4px;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BOCXND9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book Drive&quot; width=&quot;49.5%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bi-annual book drive, which takes place on a busy Manhattan street corner through an entire Saturday, is one of our opportunities to demo our robots to the general public. Because Tribeca is both a professional and a residential neighborhood, we get the opportunity to talk about robotics and STEM with many businesspeople etc. who may not otherwise be interested in STEM as well as many children who are passing by with their parents. Since FTC robots are less dangerous, smaller and therefore easier to maneuver, we often allow children to try their hand at driving which is always a really exciting thing for them. We talk to many parents about what programs their kid may be able to get involved in including Jr. FLL or FLL. And since we are selling hundreds of used books, this is another way we fund our teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Barnes and Noble&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way we are able to both spark interest in robotics among children while also fundraising is by partnering with the Barnes and Noble across the street from our school and doing a demonstration there. Then, by using a voucher, a portion of any purchase made would be donated to our team. So parents who enjoyed our demonstration were able to purchase cool books or toys in Barnes and Noble while helping our team fundraise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tutoring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way that we are able to help our local community is by tutoring. There are 3 elementary schools within a few blocks of us as well as a couple of middle schools. Last year we taught many different grades at once, which we will continue to do this year but this year we also had a specific SHSAT (the test required to get into one of the specialized high schools of which Stuyvesant High School has the highest cutoff) oriented tutoring program for 8th graders just a couple of months before they took the test for any last minute help or questions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
A large part of our team’s outreach is centered around mentoring FLL and other FTC teams. Between our members, we mentor a total of 6 FLL teams as well as 1 FTC team while starting 2 more which are still in their pre-rookie stages. Megan mentors a FLL team from RoboMindTech, Lili mentors a team from the Manhattan Montessori school named the Thunderbots, JT mentors two teams from Yung Wing Elementary School as well as two teams from I.S. 318. Our sister team, FRC StuyPulse 694 recently visited China as part of their outreach. While there they started FIRST Global which is meant to connect teams from all around the world. However, because of funding, the vast majority of these teams will end up being FTC teams rather than FRC teams. Our sister team was not interested in mentoring but we have been in communication with teams in Myanmar through a messaging platform called Discord. Two pre-rookie teams were also started by this team, one in a school for economically disadvantaged students who has a partnership with Grand Street Settlement for after school programs and another in Namibia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to really boost the ability to help a team so far away so we are in the midst of starting our own YouTube channel. We are able to see now what rookie FTC teams really get stuck on and therefore will be better equipped to give information in these videos that will be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentoring FLL teams allows us to interact with the FIRST community in a way that is deeply impactful but also personally rewarding. Not only do we get to teach kids aspects of engineering and programming that will help them in competitions and experiences to come, but we also have a chance to get them interested in a field that does not always have a reputation for being silly, fun, or kid-friendly. It’s rewarding for us as mentors to watch kids having creating robots that, for example, say “ow!” when they bump into walls, or fall over giggling when the robot crashes and loses all of its wheels at once. They bring a silliness to robotics that is often hard to find in higher levels of competition. While we hope to inspire them to pursue their interest in STEAM, they remind us to approach challenges with creativity and whimsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In School Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bake Sales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before many of the holidays, the Stuyvesant Robotics teams hosts a bake sale. Last year we held 4 but this year we hope to increase that number to 5 or 6. This is a great opportunity for us to connect with our school because with a school with over 3000 students, it is very easy for people to not know much about how the robotics team works or how we are doing. But this also helps with our funding. Every member of the team is required to bring in baked goods such as cookies, pies or cake which will then be sold to the school. Even selling at a dollar per plate we can make up to $1700! This year we have already had one bake sale for Halloween and will have another one right after our first qualifier on Monday, December 11th. Every member of our teams is required to volunteer their free periods/lunch periods to help sell these baked goods with the help with parents who stay around all day to help supervise and manage the money (a school rule is that students are not allowed to handle large amounts of money). Likewise, because we are not allowed to use phones in school, we also have no photos of these bake sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Food and Coat Drives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with some of the big community service groups at Stuyvesant High School such as our school’s Red Cross club, we have hosted food drives every year in the recent past. We collect canned goods and other non perishable foods. Every member is required to bring in three items and Red Cross gives out hours for this as well to encourage their members to participate. This is the first year that we have done a coat drive which is still ongoing. It is very difficult to remain in good health without coats to keep warm during what can be really brutal New York winters. Thus far we have collected 137 coats and this coat drive is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cyber Stuy and Open House&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnering with the Computer Science department, Stuyvesant Robotics has hosted an interactive open house for NYC middle school students who may in the future attend Stuyvesant High School or go on to participate in STEM industries. We were able to discuss code, how CV helps us program our robots. We received many questions from interested students which we were very happy to see.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
Based on the popular MIT Splash, Stuyvesant Robotics created an annual one day, robotics-centered event called Stuy Splash. Filled with presentations from industry leaders but also veteran members from our team, Stuy Splash is a fun experience for the range of teams that attend. In previous years, this was mostly for FRC teams, even though our school’s two FTC teams were involved. In fact, last year was the first time FTC teams gave presentations. A member of our team, Jonathan Lu, presented “Intro to Autodesk Fusion 360 for FTC” and Stuy Fusion 479, the other FTC team also presented. This year, while Stuy Fusion 479 is not presenting, two members of our team is. Jessica (JT) Tao, our president, is presenting “FTC: Design and Strategy” a presentation that will go over some of the most important parts of design choices FTC teams can make - the type of wheel for example or methods of lifting as well as talk about the importance of strategy and scouting in FTC competitions, something that is often neglected by rookie teams. Jonathan Lu will be speaking about 3D printing and giving a brief overview about how FTC teams can use this in their robot. Professor Hod Lipson, a robotics engineer from Columbia University, is our keynote speaker with a presentation titled “Endgame: The Six Waves of Robotics and AI”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuy Splash has really grown in popularity in recent years. Last year about 80 people showed up but this year we have already gotten over 100 sign ups and there is still plenty of time to do so. We have made changes including a time for networking and we will be providing food this year to encourage more people to show up. We have had many more sign ups for speaking as well, in fact we now have enough to warrant holding 3 lectures at the same time. Our team is helping out at this event by contacting the NYC FTC teams through social media in hopes for this event to be more FTC oriented in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Success]]></title><description><![CDATA[Thank you.
