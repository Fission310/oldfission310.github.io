As much as I loved the hands-on aspect of cutting and gluing, what really captivated me was the design process, and the creative nature of engineering. The progression from an idea to a plan to a functional object creates a sense of accomplishment that is difficult to find in other hobbies. Joining Stuy Fission 310 during my freshman year felt natural. Robotics encourages the same kind of creative problem solving I loved about model airplanes, and success as a team is based on a good execution of the design process. My favorite parts of the season are the days I spend brainstorming with my team, joking around and coming up with creative and sometimes crazy solutions to the game&apos;s challenges. As a leader, I focus on documentation, coordinating outreach and sponsorships, and newbie education such that my team can grow into the future. \n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Megan Gupta-She</h3>\n<p>Sophomore, Vice President</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 512px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.2109375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Megan\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/0b917dcf8ad3d0e6911f43b18073e121/8674a/Megan.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0b917dcf8ad3d0e6911f43b18073e121/f97cf/Megan.jpg 200w,\n/static/0b917dcf8ad3d0e6911f43b18073e121/78195/Megan.jpg 400w,\n/static/0b917dcf8ad3d0e6911f43b18073e121/8674a/Megan.jpg 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nWhen I was young, my parents thought that it was very important to try everything to try to find what you love. I tried everything from ballet to art to robotics. I was lucky enough to find what I love so early on. Through all the insane things that I have tried, robotics has always stuck. When I came to Stuyvesant, I was overwhelmed, as everyone is when they walk through the entrance on the first day of school. Getting lost at such a large school is easy and everyone needs someplace that grounds them. Robotics is that place for me. I love every part of the competition, the building, marketing, scouting, strategics, the mentors and mentees and it has become a part of my identity. As the vice president of this team, I work to move our team forward whether that is writing the Engineering Notebook, teaching newbies, delegating building and coding, organizing outreach events, or meeting with mentors and coaches to discuss different aspects of the team. This robotics team has become my family and there is no other team I’d rather go through competition season with. I enjoy mentoring 2 FLL teams and playing lacrosse in my free time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Cabinet</h2>\n<h3>Arizit Pal</h3>\n<p>Senior, Head of Engineering</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 512px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.2109375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Arizit\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/686125990f012bc1a57e846b3fae9808/8674a/Arizit.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/686125990f012bc1a57e846b3fae9808/f97cf/Arizit.jpg 200w,\n/static/686125990f012bc1a57e846b3fae9808/78195/Arizit.jpg 400w,\n/static/686125990f012bc1a57e846b3fae9808/8674a/Arizit.jpg 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nI was always interested in engineering and coming up with creative solutions to problems. Whether these solutions involved LEGOs, paper, or even popsicle sticks, I enjoyed the creativity and the variability of my solutions. By joining robotics and FTC, I was able to continue what I love doing. Except now, it’s not LEGOs anymore, but metal, wood, and aluminum where we use these parts to build actual robots that can do specific tasks. As the Head of Engineering, I am responsible for the completion of the various mechanisms and prototypes and the integration into our robot. I believe our robot can strive towards higher expectations, because our team is constantly being challenged from our own peers and mentors. These past 3 years on the team has been great and fun to work with because each year there is something different among the game, the robot and even our team. As a senior at Stuy, here’s to one more unforgettable last year. ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)</p>\n<h3>Joe Suzuki</h3>\n<p>Senior, Head of Software Engineering</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 512px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.2109375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Joe\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/c46efb8cf82dc28c8f7720269e0b5768/8674a/Joe.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c46efb8cf82dc28c8f7720269e0b5768/f97cf/Joe.jpg 200w,\n/static/c46efb8cf82dc28c8f7720269e0b5768/78195/Joe.jpg 400w,\n/static/c46efb8cf82dc28c8f7720269e0b5768/8674a/Joe.jpg 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nGrowing up in Queens, NY I always envisioned myself doing something in the big city, Manhattan. I’ll admit, I had no idea what I wanted to do in the city, but the dream of transforming people’s lives for the greater always sparked an inner flame. I suppose you can say that I was inspired by my favorite superhero Tony Stark. The first Iron Man film inspired me to love robotics. So it was definitely no surprise that I chose to join my school’s FTC Robotics team as a freshman in high school. I started out an engineer on the team but it was only after the first qualifiers of my sophomore year that I saw how lacking the Software Engineering department was. From that point on I decided to change gears and become a software engineer for the team. Now as a senior in high school, I can look back at all the ways I changed, but also look forward to how I can influence others around me. This year, I will step in the shoes of my predecessors and fulfill the role of leading the SE department. I know this year will be challenging, leading a group of newbies was never a common skill of mine, but with the support of my team, I know that I can do something that younger Joe could only dream of. I made it my mission to motivate the generation before me and I know that by leading my current SE team to the best of my ability now, they will be able to carry my vision to the next generation and the generation after that.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Members</h2>\n<h3>Nafis Uddin</h3>\n<p>Senior, Engineering</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 512px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.2109375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Nafis\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/bc12c49d44491d799b9afa41b3770c6d/8674a/Nafis.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/bc12c49d44491d799b9afa41b3770c6d/f97cf/Nafis.jpg 200w,\n/static/bc12c49d44491d799b9afa41b3770c6d/78195/Nafis.jpg 400w,\n/static/bc12c49d44491d799b9afa41b3770c6d/8674a/Nafis.jpg 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nAs a child, my eagerness to learn was only surpassed by my awkwardness around others. I found it troublesome connecting with others for few of my peers had the same background as I did. I was an immigrant coming from Bangladesh and my parents had, from an early age on, stressed the importance of a well-rounded education. I found my niche at Stuyvesant High School and specifically in Team Fission. It was an environment that nurtured my passion for the maths and sciences, but more importantly, it allowed me to shed my former shyness. Joining the robotics team taught me the importance of people skills and synergy. Working closely with the team and hearing their ideas encouraged me to speak up more and share my own opinion. As a senior, my time with the team — the long meetings, the late dinners, the competitions, the cheering — has immensely shaped my character, and what I’ve learned about teamwork and working amongst others is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. </p>\n<h3>Emily Tan</h3>\n<p>Freshman, Engineering</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 512px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.2109375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Emily\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/9f3739ea08c4d86419f349c59066a154/8674a/Emily.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9f3739ea08c4d86419f349c59066a154/f97cf/Emily.jpg 200w,\n/static/9f3739ea08c4d86419f349c59066a154/78195/Emily.jpg 400w,\n/static/9f3739ea08c4d86419f349c59066a154/8674a/Emily.jpg 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nMy name is Qiao Ying (Emily) and this is my first year in robotics.

Each individual part that made up the clock intrigued me. The composition of seemingly simple pieces worked together to create a functioning machine with a specific purpose. During middle school, I experimented with code and developed a liking towards it. Similar to the alarm clock, the composition of each line of code worked together to form a program. I joined robotics because I want to develop and apply my ability to code to a project that I can work on with others.</p>\n<h3>Tasnuba Sukanna</h3>\n<p>Senior, Marketing</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 512px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.2109375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBf/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECA//aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABZOmbO9onE//EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMEERIh/9oACAEBAAEFArPZQeWmSxW1HIs3P//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ/9oACAECAQE/AQZ//8QAHRAAAAUFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEBESQVFxgf/aAAgBAQAGPwKm0BSOsWhOW//EABkQAQEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAEEhMf/aAAgBAQABPyEqKR+pmfVAi81HTFud4+HG/wD/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEKvv/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD/2gAIAQMBAT8QUn//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAgEBPxAI/8QAGxABAAMBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIVExkbH/2gAIAQEAAT8QZFiDK05vIUcg+w+QYvmUcCtiY23Ha09uRqn/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Tasnuba\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/bfec4fa22215695dc2544e33adfcebc6/8674a/Tas.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/bfec4fa22215695dc2544e33adfcebc6/f97cf/Tas.jpg 200w,\n/static/bfec4fa22215695dc2544e33adfcebc6/78195/Tas.jpg 400w,\n/static/bfec4fa22215695dc2544e33adfcebc6/8674a/Tas.jpg 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nAs a child, I loved reading mystery/spy fiction books, where characters got out of sticky situations using their wits and abilities. I was always in awe of the characters who would resourcefully build a contraption or use their knowledge of mechanisms to figure things out. I fueled this interest by watching YouTube videos and reading instructions on WikiHow to make my own motion detectors and homemade mousetrap cars. If not begging my mom to take to me to RadioShack, I would always take old pens and electronic toys apart, salvaging the parts and hoarding them for years, just in case I needed them for a project. When I entered high school, robotics was the only club I had my eyes for. Our victory banners covering the walls of our school gave me a sense of pride and excitement to join and contribute. Joining this team was critical for my development because I suddenly realized there was so much I didn’t know. Especially because the majority of my teammates were in FLL teams and already familiar with robotics, I felt super isolated from my team. However, this gave me the opportunity to figure out what exactly I was missing and work on it. As a freshman, I was intimidated by the upperclassmen but soon gained confidence talk to them about their experiences in engineering. This helped me to take initiative outside of school and robotics, and pave my passion for engineering.</p>\n<h3>Henry lin</h3>\n<p>Freshman, Engineering</p>\n<p>From a very young age, my parents always expected very much of me. They would always compare me to others and tell me how I’m lacking behind. To please them, I tried to make it to stuy, and I ended up doing just that. The first day here, I could already tell it’s going to be very hard, with the amount of stairs we have to climb and quizzes and test every week. I joined robotics as a way to relieve my stress and have some fun making new friends. My personal hobbies and interests are sleeping, eating, playing, and watching anime. By joining robotics, I hope to find someone with the same interest as me.</p>\n<h3>Kelly Hu</h3>\n<p>Freshman, Software Engineering</p>\n<p>Growing up, I loved to create things. I have always been more interested in the tangible and things that take up space. That is why I picked up drawing. It was a way for me to make things that are also visually appealing. However, I soon learned that it would not be of much use to me in the future to just draw. Though I have no hate to those with art degrees and careers involving the arts, I feel that it would never benefit me in any way other than to be to brag about how well I draw; which isn’t that well at all. So when I learned that Stuyvesant had a robotics team, I knew that it would be the perfect club for me. Robotics can give me a chance to learn how to make machines and program them to do tasks that we can do. Furthermore, programming had always caught my interest in this growing age of technology. The only problem was that I didn’t know how to start learning, so when I was given an opportunity to learn it, I took it. That is why I joined robotics.</p>\n<h3>Naomi Naranjo</h3>\n<p>Freshman, Engineering</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 512px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.2109375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Naomi\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/c403afbb69bb63e2604cb355f86a9664/8674a/Naomi.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c403afbb69bb63e2604cb355f86a9664/f97cf/Naomi.jpg 200w,\n/static/c403afbb69bb63e2604cb355f86a9664/78195/Naomi.jpg 400w,\n/static/c403afbb69bb63e2604cb355f86a9664/8674a/Naomi.jpg 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nMy name is Naomi, and this is my first year in robotics. Since I was a child I always loved the idea of being on a team and getting to work with others to create something new. So when I learned that Stuyvesant had a robotics team, I quickly signed up. So far it has been a great experience being on 310 and learning from the mentors on my time. I look forward to spending time in robotics, and with my new team. Some other things that I enjoy in my free time are reading and songwriting.</p>\n<h3>Marko Zimic</h3>\n<p>Freshman, Engineering</p>\n<p>I joined robotics because I have done robotics with FIRST for a long time and I really liked it, so I wanted to maintain the action by joining Stuy’s team.

A lot of my friends also joined robotics so I thought why not also join. since I would also prefer a job in engineering or something related to that, robotics could help give me some experience.  I like robotics because it can prepare me for jobs, its somewhat easy going, and its enjoyable. Outside of robotics I like to eat, sleep, and stay somewhere warm.</p>\n<h3>Navid Kashem</h3>\n<p>Senior, Honorary Head of Engineering</p>\n<p>Robotics has been a huge part of my life ever since 5th grade, when I was first introduced to robotics and LEGO Mindstorms. It was in middle school when I was first introduced to FIRST through FLL. From my first competition, I know I wanted to do this for a long time. So, when I came to Stuyvesant, I joined the robotics team. However, I didn’t join Stuy Fission. I joined FRC 694 StuyPulse. I’m now spending my fourth year on the team, and am currently the President of Engineering. My time with FTC starts in junior year when one of our sister teams, FTC 479 Stuy Fusion, was extremely short on members. I joined them, and helped them with their robot as much as possible inside and out of competition. This is when I became attached to FTC. This year, I joined FTC 310 Stuy Fission and work to help the team specifically with engineering and strategy. I hope to put my passion for robotics to use and help this amazing team reach new heights.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Coaches and Mentors</h2>\n<h3>James Lonardo</h3>\n<p>Coach</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 512px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Lonardo\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/100187a14c5cca000273fa89796ef2e3/f6050/Lonardo.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/100187a14c5cca000273fa89796ef2e3/3af91/Lonardo.png 200w,\n/static/100187a14c5cca000273fa89796ef2e3/8f9d7/Lonardo.png 400w,\n/static/100187a14c5cca000273fa89796ef2e3/f6050/Lonardo.png 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nJames Lonardo has served our team for over eight years.

His incredible dedication to the team is really an inspiration to us, reminding us, especially the seniors, the importance of coming back and continuing to influence and contribute to the team even after graduation. His presence is also what allows us to have our late night or weekend meetings that are crucial to ensuring that our robot is completed in a timely manner. This year he has become more committed to helping our team get the furthest we have ever gotten. He has helped us come up with unique ideas for mechanisms, calculate torque and speed to make crucial choices, complete driver tryouts, etc. </p>\n<h3>Levi Olevsky</h3>\n<p>Mentor</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 464px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Levi\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ef4ce284b3d8a7fbc4105916d217c5cc/967c0/Levi.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ef4ce284b3d8a7fbc4105916d217c5cc/0604f/Levi.png 200w,\n/static/ef4ce284b3d8a7fbc4105916d217c5cc/a94bd/Levi.png 400w,\n/static/ef4ce284b3d8a7fbc4105916d217c5cc/967c0/Levi.png 464w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nLevi is a StuyPulse alum, who graduated just last year and now attends New York University, majoring Mechanical Engineering. Since then he has come back and continued to work with 694 (our sister FRC team) as well as move more into FTC. He has helped us immensely with prototyping the tape measure mechanism as well as gearing and motor calculations. Levi has become someone that many of us rely on for anything from a friend to a mentor.</p>\n<h3>Noah Tom-Wong</h3>\n<p>Mentor</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 512px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Naoh\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ccaf9a8a813162c4d9fb6021777e91db/f6050/Noah.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ccaf9a8a813162c4d9fb6021777e91db/3af91/Noah.png 200w,\n/static/ccaf9a8a813162c4d9fb6021777e91db/8f9d7/Noah.png 400w,\n/static/ccaf9a8a813162c4d9fb6021777e91db/f6050/Noah.png 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </a>\nNoah, like Levi, is a StuyPulse alum. He has been mentoring teams since as long as anyone can remember. He is very passionate and is not afraid to say what he thinks. This is a great quality to have as a mentor because that means he is not afraid to tell us what is wrong with whatever we are doing whether that is judge’s meet or our acquirer or newbie education. Noah has been there for us since day one, even mentoring our vice president when she was in FLL. </p>\n<h3>Zhengqi Xi</h3>\n<p>Mentor</p>\n<p>Zhengqi started as a mentor for us through a Bloomberg program and has been with us ever since. He is able to facilitate many of the conversations we have about design and engineering season because of his background in the fields of robotics and engineering.</p>\n<h3>Mel Hauptman</h3>\n<p>Mentor</p>\n<p>Mel has helped us tremendously this year especially in our engineering process. Being a mechanical engineer, he has a very solid foundation and can predict all the faults of our designs. He has been useful when talking about all of our different hanging mechanisms and he has definitely helped us avoid some disastrous design issues. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Our Team"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"facebook":{"appId":""}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/team/","source":"pages"}}
