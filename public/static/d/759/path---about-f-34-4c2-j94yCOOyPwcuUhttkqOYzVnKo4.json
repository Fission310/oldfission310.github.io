Our team is comprised of dedicated Stuyvesant High School students who not only wish to do well in competition but also to spread the values of FIRST. We all come from very diverse backgrounds; for some of us, this is our first time getting involved in STEM,  while others of us have been involved in FLL and other programs. Being part of the team not only allows us to be part of a family that shares the same interests, but it also allows us to learn from each other and grow.</p>\n<p>Our team becomes a family not only because of our shared interests, but also because of the dedication each and every member shows. Members of our team juggle keeping their grades up in a competitive school as well as spending time together almost every day. In the final weeks of build season, the team stays after school until 9 pm, and then on Saturdays from 10 am to 5 pm. This is largely possible thanks to our hardworking mentors, whom we owe much of our success. On top of this, many of our members mentor FLL and other FTC teams.</p>\n<p>Though these late meetings are often difficult to manage, they bring our team together. Late meetings include communal dinners, team bonding activities (snowball fights, stacking the cubes with our feet as well as actual bonding events like bowling etc.), and the sometimes hilarious situations that arise as we build (we really never fail to make each other laugh).</p>\n<h3>About Stuyvesant High School</h3>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b831490b0d94b7dcea98e039be4ded77/98e59/stuy.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.54135338345864%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Stuyvesant High School\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b831490b0d94b7dcea98e039be4ded77/78f2b/stuy.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b831490b0d94b7dcea98e039be4ded77/dce19/stuy.jpg 200w,\n/static/b831490b0d94b7dcea98e039be4ded77/c1413/stuy.jpg 400w,\n/static/b831490b0d94b7dcea98e039be4ded77/78f2b/stuy.jpg 800w,\n/static/b831490b0d94b7dcea98e039be4ded77/ab4c4/stuy.jpg 1200w,\n/static/b831490b0d94b7dcea98e039be4ded77/bc99b/stuy.jpg 1600w,\n/static/b831490b0d94b7dcea98e039be4ded77/34a60/stuy.jpg 2400w,\n/static/b831490b0d94b7dcea98e039be4ded77/98e59/stuy.jpg 4256w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \nStuyvesant High School, a.k.a. “Stuy”, one of New York City’s specialized high schools for math and science, has demonstrated a tradition of excellence for over a century.
